# Linker
Apple IIGS ORCA Linker, a link editor for the Apple IIGS object module format

If you would like to make changes to this linker and distribute them to others, feel free to submit them here. If the changes apply to compilation on and for an Apple IIGS, they will generally be approved for distribution on the master branch. For changes that run on a different platform, the project will either be forked or a new repository will be created, as appropriate.

The general conditions that must be met before a change is released on master are:

1. The modified linker must compile under the currently released version of ORCA/M.

2. The ORCA compilers must pass their test suites using the new linker, or the test suite must be suitably modified, too.

Contact support@byteworks.us if you need contributor access.

A complete distribution of the ORCA languages, including installers and documentation, is available from the Juiced GS store at https://juiced.gs/store/category/software/. It is distributed as part of the Opus ][ package.
